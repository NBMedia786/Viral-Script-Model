Investigating the double homicide, detectives had no idea that it was just the beginning of a mystery that would change everything forever.\n\nThe deranged motive behind this unspeakable act would soon unravel and prove to be the catalyst of a dark and sinister secret.\n\n\n===================\n\nDetectives were able to identify them as Britney and her longtime girlfriend, Crystal. It was evident that both Britney and Crystal’s final moments had been deeply traumatizing. And as they began scavenging through the crime scene, they discovered some crucial evidence highlighting the gruesome details of the double homicide.\n\nIvan told the detectives that the girls had stopped by the Jackson residence to pick up Zaniah and proudly show off the new car they had just purchased together. But things didn’t quite go as Crystal had imagined. \n\nAs the days went by and the investigation dragged on, the detective eventually received the autopsy report for the two girls. It confirmed that Crystal had been killed by a gunshot wound, while Britney had died as a result of blunt force trauma. \nThe detectives were still considering Ivan as a potential suspect. However, further details from the report revealed something that turned the case even more twisted, setting the stage for shocking revelations and a trail of new, unexpected leads.\n\nThe bullet that struck Crystal was from a firearm of a higher caliber than Ivan’s own gun.\nAnd in the effort to completely clear his name, Ivan consented to let them question Zaniah, who had been with Britney and Crystal on the day they disappeared.\nWithout delay, an officer escorted the young girl into a separate room. And once the detectives learned about the horrors Zaniah had witnessed, they were left stunned—realizing she might be holding the missing piece to a nightmare no one saw coming.\n\nAnd when she told the detectives what she had heard that morning, they were rattled to the core, because her words pointed to a potential killer who could be hiding in plain sight.\n\nBut what they saw in another footage from a different part of the city, left them stunned. Neither Britney nor Crystal was in the driver’s seat. Instead, the individual behind the wheel was clearly someone else. Based on the person’s height and build, it was evident they were male. Unfortunately, the surveillance camera had been positioned too far away to provide a clear image of the driver’s face, leaving the detectives frustrated yet determined to dig deeper, slowly inching towards uncovering a crucial piece of evidence.\n\nAs they reached the carport, Kitchens immediately pulled out his recorder, ready to document whatever Cora had to reveal. What she said next hinted at a secret far darker than anyone was prepared for.\n\n\nIntrigued, Kitchens began carefully surveying the carport, initially seeing nothing out of place. However, as his eyes scanned the area more closely, he spotted a small pile of bricks on the concrete floor. And tucked beneath them was a detail so subtle, yet so sinister that it would change the course of the investigation forever.\n\nMeanwhile, in the forensic lab, experts worked tirelessly to analyze the evidence collected from the crime scenes.\n\nIt was during one of these moments that something finally clicked for the detectives. A chilling pattern was beginning to emerge. One that had been hidden in plain sight all along.\n\n\n\n\nPatricia Birmingham\n\nWith the CCTV it was confirmed that Carey was trying to pursue Patricia menacingly but what followed is even more terrifying. Detectives are about to discover something on her phone would shake them to the core.\n\nHowever until they recovered the data in her phone they decided to dig deeper into the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nWith this, the detective’s earlier suspicions were confirmed that Carey had been deliberately trying to harm Patricia. But one question still remained: why would he want to kill his own wife? The answer was coming and it would be far more terrifying than anyone expected. It was a horrifying truth, all captured live on camera by Patricia herself.\n\nIn the upcoming visuals, make sure to pay close attention, particularly to the way he was dressed, which strongly showed he was in a manic state. \n\n",
