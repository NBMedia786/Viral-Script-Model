  "script_text": "Megan Huntsman — Voice Dialogues (Formatted)\nMegan Huntsman — Voice Dialogues (Left Column Only)\nVoiceover\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Darren West who had just found a dead body hidden in his  garage. But that was nothing compared to what chilling discovery the officers were about to make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen officers first arrived at the gruesome scene, they had no idea what dark secrets were hidden behind the doors. But as they began uncovering a series of damning clues, it quickly became clear that this wasn’t just a meticulously planned murder—it was something far more sinister and the killer was much closer to home than anyone expected.\nHorrifying discovery\n\nOn April 12, 2014 Darren had returned home after serving time in prison for drug charges only to stumble upon a horrifying scene in his garage and  make this disturbing 911 call. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen police arrived at Pleasant Grove, Utah, they saw the garage door wide open and Darren stood outside with his family, who had come to help him move in. Just one look at him, and the officers knew they were in for something dreadful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe house had once belonged to Darren’s mother, and before he went to prison, he had lived there with his wife, Megan Huntsman, and their three daughters. But now, the place was a chaotic mess with piles of boxes scattered everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box in question was an ordinary-looking fruit box, sitting just outside the garage and its exterior was tightly sealed with electrical tape. Inside, they found a bag, also wrapped in layer upon layer of duct tape, as if someone desperately wanted to keep whatever was inside hidden forever. When the investigators finally peeled it open, what they discovered would haunt them for years to come. It was the lifeless body of a fully decomposed baby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe officers quickly sealed off the scene, unsure of what had truly happened, but one thing was clear—it was now a homicide investigation. They began searching the area, moving from box to box, not knowing that what they had just uncovered was just the beginning of a much darker and more chilling story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the question was where was Megan? Right now she was the only person who could hold the answers to this troubling mystery. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarren had already called Megan, and what she told him was almost impossible to believe. She claimed the baby was his, from way back in 2006: a child he had no idea even existed but could that even be possible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for the time being, the officers focused on Megan to understand about the unfolding events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t just Darren who was disturbed—the neighbors had also noticed a strange, foul smell coming from the garage. As more officers arrived at the scene they were tasked with meticulously searching every inch of the property of what was quickly becoming known as the “house of horror”.\nMegan questioning\n\nMeanwhile, Megan was brought in for questioning by Detective Beckstrom. His first goal was to understand why she had hidden the baby instead of reporting it to the authorities or seeking medical help. However, in a few moments, the story took a turn more twisted than ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegan repeated the same story she had told Darren—that the baby had been a stillborn. Despite appearing visibly upset, there were many details in Megan’s account that just didn't add up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegan’s story seemed like a justification- with her husband gone to prison, she was left overwhelmed with stress and was deeply influenced by drugs which clouded her state of mind. But the more the detective spoke with her, the more their doubts grew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat struck as odd was Megan’s fear of going to jail if the baby was truly a stillborn. If no crime had been committed, aside from the unlawful disposal of the body, why did she carry such a heavy guilt? There was something deeper she wasn’t saying, and the detective could feel it. Meanwhile, at the house, the officers pressed on with their search which led them to another suspicious box. Inside, they uncovered a deeply disturbing scene— that was just the start.\nShocking revelations\n\nEach box they opened carried an overpowering stench, with a strange liquid seeping through the bottom of the bags inside. The officers immediately reported it to Detective Beckstrom who confronted Megan in hopes to get answers, but nothing could have prepared him for her response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegan had a long history of drug abuse, particularly methamphetamine, and was known to drink heavily as well. These addictions had ruined her ability to make rational decisions, but they were no excuse for taking a life. Despite her claims, it was clear she was still hiding something—a truth so gruesome, which would shake everyone to the core.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hearing that more bodies were hidden in the garage, Detective Beckstrom quickly contacted the officers on the scene. Over 20 to 30 officers combed through every inch of the house, searching for hours and while the investigation continued, so did the interrogation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was painfully evident that this case was far from straightforward. While it wasn’t unheard of for a woman to hide a pregnancy but doing so multiple times raised serious doubts. The idea seemed almost impossible to believe, and as the detectives pieced things together, a chilling realisation began to take shape.\nDetective Beckstrom was left stunned when Megan finally admitted the unthinkable—it wasn’t an accident, but actual murders. So now he asked her the final make-or-break question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the detective left the room, he could barely contain the emotions that overwhelmed him. It had been the hardest interrogation of his career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack at the crime scene, the officers had been searching the garage for over three hours and the unease they felt couldn't be measured. No one could have predicted what other surprises lay in store for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn’t take long before the officers found the third body, packed tightly in a box and sealed with layers of duct tape. When they carefully opened it, they found the body to be wrapped in a plastic bag and covered in vinyl. As their search continued, they uncovered a fourth body, followed by a fifth, hidden under two blankets and two bath tiles in the bottom left corner of a cubby. But just when they thought they had seen it all, the biggest shock was still about to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers kept growing, but the officers knew they had to proceed with caution. The line of questioning soon shifted as Detective Beckstrom began to consider Darren’s possible involvement due to something Megan had said earlier during the interrogation that had caught his attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was hard to believe that Darren had simply stumbled upon the body in his garage without any clue where it could have come from. Could he have known more than he was letting on? Meanwhile, back at the crime scene, officers made another grim discovery—the sixth and seventh bodies, wrapped in sweaters and stuffed into a box inside a cabinet. It was a moment that left everyone reeling, but they still pressed on, to determine if there were more than seven. They even searched Megan’s former home in West Valley, leaving no stone unturned. While they found no additional bodies, they did uncover Xanax, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia, painting a bleak picture of her life.\nDarren in question\n\nMegan Huntsman was arrested and booked into the Utah County Jail on six counts of murder. However, the case was far from complete—still there were pieces of the puzzle that didn’t quite fit and to fill in the gaps, investigators brought Darren in for questioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarren was visibly shaken by the disturbing revelations. He buried his face in his hands and began to sob as the weight of the situation hit him hard. But despite his tears, there was more he needed to explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though Darren claimed he had no idea about the pregnancies, the detective wasn’t ready to accept it at face value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Darren seemed like a potential suspect in the case, there was no evidence to link him to the murders. Eventually, Darren requested an attorney, bringing the interrogation to an abrupt end. What worked in his favor was a simple but strong point—if he had known about the bodies in the garage, it was unlikely he would have started cleaning it so soon after his release from prison.\nEvidences\n\nDarren was released from custody, and the investigation moved forward with Megan still behind bars. All the evidence collected from the garage—including the boxes, plastic bags, and layers of duct tape—was sent to the lab for analysis and the results were conclusive: every single fingerprint belonged to Megan. Not a trace of Darren’s prints was found on any of the items. With this, the focus shifted to the medical examiner, where DNA testing was conducted to confirm the father of the babies.\n\nThe results were as expected—Darren was the biological father of all seven children. However, one heartbreaking fact remained clear: during their entire 10 years of living together and even after he went to prison in 2006, Darren had no idea he had fathered seven children. Megan had hidden everything from him and everyone else.\nFinal decision\n\nIt was now time for the final decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn February 12, 2015 Megan was formally charged with six counts of first-degree murder. Having admitted to killing six of her children—while claiming one was stillborn—she was sentenced to six terms of five years to life, to be served consecutively which meant she would spend the rest of her life in prison. The case left everyone involved deeply shaken. It was incomprehensible how a mother could commit such horrific acts. It also highlighted the devastating impact of drugs, which had completely destroyed Megan’s mental health and led her down this dark and tragic path.\nOutro\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this case? Was it just drugs which led to Megan killing her children or were there some other dark motives? How did Darren not know anything about his wife's pregnancies after living together for 10 years?\n\nWe'd love to hear from you!
