But what unfolded would reveal a calculated killer who tried to play god. \n\n\n\n\nThe scene was filled with piercing screams and heartbreaking cries. Her family was shattered, unable to process the horror unfolding right in front of them.\n\n\nLashonda had been shot once, just beneath her eye. Paramedics arrived quickly, hoping there was still time to save her. However, after examining the injury closely, they had to deliver the heartbreaking truth: there was nothing more they could do.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven the detectives were stunned by the sheer unpredictability of the shot, as the bullet had pierced straight through the peek window on the main door. This wasn't a break-in gone wrong, this was an assassination disguised as a drive-by.\n\n\n\n\nThe detectives then turned to the family, urging them to recount everything they knew about the night, and more importantly, to share if there was anyone Lashonda may have been in conflict with or had reason to fear. The family's answer would point detectives toward a man consumed by rage and a thirst for revenge.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe family had given police a solid lead but the name they were about to reveal would finally give detectives a clear direction to follow.\n\nAccording to the family, the suspect was believed to be 41-year-old Curtrez Darale Johnson, Lashonda’s ex. till, none of it meant anything without proof. \n\n\nDetectives built their case on suspicious sightings and Darale constantly avoiding police. Surveillance caught him at Sun Ray Shopping Center twice, but on December 27, 2022, his second visit would end with an arrest and subsequent questioning.\n\n\nINTERROGATION\n\n\nDarale shares that his son was shot on December 13, 2022, just days before Lashonda’s death, luckily he survived. However, Darale blamed Lashonda for the attack, even though she’d maintained innocence about it to him earlier.\n\n\nDarale spoke of riding past houses, to keep an eye on whom he thought shot his son. These instances would be caught on CCTV and would eventually lead to detectives finding the key to exposing the truth.\n\n\nThe detectives pressed him about driving by their house, which sounded suspicious and almost creepy. But he insisted that he was just trying to find justice for his son, and that everyone at the house was ignoring him. Little did he know, his own admissions were building the case against him.\n\nNo matter what detectives asked, he tried to bring up his story, trying to be the grieving father. However, they kept him on track, focusing on the drive-bys.\n\nDarale spoke of justice, but his actions hinted at something darker: intimidation, even calculated stalking. What he didn’t realize was that, with every subtle question, the walls around him were closing in. The mask of the grieving father was about to slip completely.\n\n\n\nThe Evidence Piles Up (Not to be voiced)\nDetectives now had a crucial question – one that centered around the gun JJ had in his possession. According to reports, he hadn’t owned it; he’d stolen it from his own uncle. This revelation would expose the web of lies Darale had carefully constructed.\n\nThen came the question, one that could make or break everything. The way he responded could determine whether he was a grieving father caught in the crossfire or a prime suspect in an alleged murder.\n\nWith every question that nudged the conversation toward Lashonda’s case, he deflected, offering short answers before circling back to his son getting shot. But the more he did it, the more suspicious it seemed. Eventually, detectives zeroed in on a particular street: Cook; a place he was seen frequenting, while stalking, or, in his words, “driving past the house” of one of the boys.\n\n\n\nAs questions about the street and his whereabouts began to pile up, Darale’s pauses grew longer, and his silence became heavier.\nDetectives knew this was a lie, because cameras had already placed him near the crime scene. As they prepared to confront him with the truth, he kept talking, slowly revealing just how capable he was of violence.\n\nThe words slipped out like a passing thought, but to seasoned detectives, it wasn’t casual at all. It was a crack in the mask, and they saw it\n\nWhat Darale didn’t know was everything from that night was captured; from his, White Tahoe circling the area, to the gunshot that killed Lashonda\n\nAs detectives laid out what the CCTV revealed, his expression stayed oddly calm. But calm didn’t mean safe—he had nowhere left to hide. Only one question remained: who was driving that night, and who pulled the trigger? That question existed because of his own claim, that it could have been either him or his girlfriend behind the wheel- words from a man who thought he was outsmarting everyone. But the evidence was about to prove just how wrong he was.\n\nThe Walls Close In (Not to be voiced)\n\nClassic denial, but his body language told a different story. The confident man who had walked into the interrogation room was replaced by someone scrambling for an explanation that didn't exist. After 23:47 \nWith Darale still holding back, the second investigator, quiet until now, steps in. The added pressure begins to crack his story and it won’t be long before the lies fall apart.\n\nAs the detective kept pressing, Darale edged closer to a mistake; unaware of what he was about to give away.\n\nThis was the moment detectives were waiting for - Darale had placed himself at the scene at the time of the murder. His attempt to maintain innocence while admitting his presence was logically impossible. \n\n\nDarale's story completely fell apart. The claim of not hearing the gunshot was absurd; he was asking detectives to believe in a level of coincidence that defied common sense. Every word he spoke only dug his grave deeper.\n\nDarale’s denials sounded like a broken record, repetitive, desperate, and completely divorced from reality.\n\n\nHis behavior shifted with each detective. He was quiet and agreeable with the female detective, but grew defensive and angry when the male detective took a softer approach, accusing them of twisting the truth and making up a story against him\n\n\nHowever, some details from Nicholas’s life clearly stand out. His wife had left him, married one of his friends and went on to have a child with him.\nOfficers believe that Nicholas’s tragic life pushed him into a downward spiral eventually leading him to his terrifying fate.\nThat 911 call was Collin’s last shot at escape and a desperate cry for help that barely scratched the surface of the abuse he’d been living through.\nWhat investigators uncovered next was a chilling betrayal, a calculated plan hidden in plain sight, and a decorated officer with a secret darker than anyone dared suspect.\n\n\n\n\n", "base_stem": "uploaded_script", "data": {"scores": {"Suspense Building": 5, "Language/Tone": 4, "Intro + Main Hook/Cliffhanger": 9, "Story Structure + Flow": 4, "Pacing": 3, "Mini-Hooks (30–60s)": 6, "Outro (Ending)": 2}, "per_parameter": {"Suspense Building": {"extractions": [], "score": 5, "explanation": "Strong initial hook and consistent mini-hooks effectively pull the audience through the interrogation.
