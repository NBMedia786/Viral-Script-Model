As a result, the cops searched her home and found something completely unexpected.\n\nThis discovery made them question if someone else in the neighbourhood was involved.\n\nAt one point, they began to consider the possibility that Rachita was innocent. But there were still too many things that couldn’t be mere coincidences. And the unanswered questions they had only Rachita could answer.\n\nSoon  Rachita arrived and detectives started questioning her regarding the incident where she acknowledged seeing Travis’ car. \n\n\nRachita stated that, Travis intentionally hit her vehicle and when her son objected, Travis threatened him with a gun. This revelation instantly made Rachita’s son a suspect in the detectives' eyes. It was possible that, due to ongoing tensions, Rachita’s son shot Travis during the altercation.\n\nThis new revelation changed the direction of the investigation, and the truth was about to come out when Rachita was called in for further interrogation at the police station.\n\n\nRachita’s Interrogation-\nAt first, the detectives asked about her relationship with Travis.\n \nAccording to her, Travis wasn’t a problem until he drank and became aggressive. But she claimed to have no idea why Travis was near her house that night.\n\nWhen asked about the whole incident, she gave a detailed account.\n\nAlthough she was inside the house when the shooting happened, she claimed to have witnessed it from her bathroom window. At this point, she didn't realize that this detail would eventually unravel her lie to the detectives.\n\nHowever, the detectives next focused on what had happened between her son and Travis just before the shooting. \n\nRachita claimed her son was not on bad terms with his stepfather, Travis, but detectives suspected she was hiding something far more sinister. When asked for her son's location, she seemed to make excuses to keep him out of the detectives' reach.\n \nDetectives found it strange that, at one point, she made them suspicious of her son, but at the same time, she was trying not to reveal much about him. \n\nDetectives saw two possibilities. Either she was trying to save herself by framing her son for the murder, or she was hiding a dark secret to protect him. \n\nTo unravel the puzzle, they paused the interrogation and looked into her son’s background and what they discovered immediately made him a suspect.\n \nWith all the new details, detectives resumed interrogation to uncover any possible motive behind the murder.  \n\nShe repeatedly denied knowing why Travis was outside his house that night, insisting that they rarely spoke. Detectives then showed a photo of her son, seeking further confirmation of their findings.\n \nNoticing her shrewd tactics when detectives showed the evidence collected from her house, she denied any involvement, but they kept pressing her. \n\nDespite their efforts, she did not reveal much and stuck to her story. So, the only option left was to speak with her son.\n\n\nCatching Lies-\nBefore reaching out to her son, the detectives verified her statements during the interrogation and uncovered multiple lies. \n \nDespite Rachita's claim, the detectives found no evidence that her truck had been hit by Travis' car, clearly exposing her lie. But that wasn’t the only lie she told; more were starting to surface.\n\nAfter uncovering her lies, detectives knew they were getting closer to the truth, and revealing her real intentions was only a matter of time. \n\nOn the morning of January 28, 2024, detectives attempted to speak with Rachita's son to gather more information, but unfortunately, they were unsuccessful. \n\nAfter Rachita's son refused to cooperate, detectives were left with limited information that made the investigation harder to continue. So, they decided to take their next step accordingly.\n\n\nThe Breakthrough-\nThough they didn’t expect much from the confidential source, they had no idea an unexpected breakthrough was coming.\n \nThe source revealed that Rachita was the one who shot Travis, and it was over something as trivial as a car bump. \n\nHowever, the statement from the confidential source was not enough to arrest Rachita and cops needed additional evidence. They then conducted a thorough re-examination of Travis' truck. \n\nThey found no sign of a gun in his truck, which exposed another of Rachita's lies. To uncover more, they took their next step, which would soon reveal something crucial they had previously missed.\n \nWhile reexamining the crime scene footage from the body cam, they spotted Rachita. \n\nAfter carefully scrutinizing bodycam footage, the detectives came to a chilling conclusion. \n\nAfter all these, she had already been proven to be a criminal-minded, evil person, but the way she tried to frame her son to escape the murder charge was truly shocking.\n\nTalking to Travis' mother, detectives uncovered even more disturbing truths about Rachita's intentions. \n \nWith this evidence, they obtained an arrest warrant for Rachita on charges of second-degree murder. But, they couldn't arrest her as she was on the run.\n\nEven 45 days after the arrest warrant was issued, Rachita remained at large. However, on March 21, 2024, she finally surrendered to the authorities.\n\nAfter her arrest, the detectives tried to question her again, but she refused to provide any additional information. \n\nHowever, the authorities were confident that they had enough evidence to prove her guilt in court, ensuring justice for Travis' family and loved ones. \n\n\nClosure:\n\nBefore we conclude we want to extend our heartfelt condolences for Travis Hobbs and his loved ones.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this case?\n\nShare your thoughts in the comment section below; we would love to hear from you.
