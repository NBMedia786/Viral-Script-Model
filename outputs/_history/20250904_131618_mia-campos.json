  "script_text": "Introduction 1\n\nThis was Jesus Monroy, a major suspect in the death of his girlfriend, 16-year-old Mia Campos.\n\n\nBut Mia’s death was anything but ordinary. What started as a missing persons case quickly spiraled into a maze of twists and turns.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, all roads seemed to lead back to her boyfriend. Soon, the police would uncover his darkest secret.\n\n\n\nIntroduction 2\nThis was the last known footage of 16-year-old Mia, captured just moments before she vanished.\n\nSoon, another 911 call confirmed that the 7-months pregnant teen had been found, abandoned in a forest. But the state she was found in was far from what anyone had hoped for.\n \n\nWith no clear leads, investigators turned their attention to the father of Mia’s unborn child.\n\n\n\n\nBut that only dragged them into a rabbit hole of lies until cops discovered the boyfriend’s chilling secret.\n\nIntro 3\n\nThis 911 call sent police rushing to the scene, where they found Mia Campos, a 7-months-pregnant teen, lying face down on the forest floor.\n\nWith no solid leads, investigators found themselves caught in a strange limbo, chasing shadows, unsure if Mia's story ended there but it had just begun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 15, 2024, at 12:45 AM, Georgia police received a 911 call reporting a missing person.\n\n\nJust after 1:00 AM, a second call came in, Mia Campos was found dead near Stephens Road in Loganville. What began as a missing person case had taken a darker turn, sending officers racing to the scene to uncover the truth.\n\n\n\nMia Campos was a high school student with dreams of becoming a veterinarian. She had recently learned she was expecting a baby boy. But in a single, tragic moment, everything was shattered.\n\nBy the looks of it, the police could identify that it was not a natural death but a horrific murder. The investigation team arrived at the scene, securing the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey began searching for visible clues to determine the cause of death.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen nothing physically suspicious stood out, the focus shifted to investigating what had led the family to the scene that night.\n\n\n\n\nThe two people who discovered Mia lying in the woods, her father, Edward Campos, and the father of her unborn child, Jesus Monroy, claimed they had located her through a friend she had previously shared her location with. To piece together the events of that night, investigators chose to interview her father first.\n\nHer father didn’t report anything suspicious, so the police turned their attention to Jesus, hoping his account would shed some light on the tragedy.\n\nAccording to Jesus when Mia revealed her pregnancy to him, she also claimed that the pregnancy resulted from a one-night stand they had together. \n\nIn response, Jesus made a bold claim, alleging he suspected Mia had recently been involved with another man. As the investigation progressed, he further claimed he believed she may have been using drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these serious accusations, there wasn’t enough evidence to draw any conclusions.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of drug involvement began to surface, a troubling angle, especially considering Mia was pregnant and aware of the responsibility she carried. For many, it was hard to imagine someone nurturing a life would put that at risk.\n\nAmid growing uncertainty, detectives remained focused on finding a lead. That’s when they received a troubling phone call from Mia’s sister, Marisol Salizar.\n\n\n\nThe call suggested that Mia’s best friend, Jordan, might hold crucial information. The detectives quickly went to her home, eager to find the truth and get justice for Mia.\nWhen they arrived at Jordan’s home, she revealed something chilling and completely unexpected.\n\n\nJordan claimed that the age gap between Mia and Jesus was a significant factor in their relationship; while Mia was 15, Jesus was 20 years old. She also revealed that Mia's friend group had always been suspicious of Jesus’ behavior.\n\nTo verify Jordan’s claims, the detectives examined Mia’s phone, hoping to find messages aligned with her account.\nWhat they found offered a glimmer of hope in uncovering the truth. Deleted messages from Mia’s phone were successfully recovered, revealing that her last known texts were at 8 PM on the night of July 14, 2024.\n\nRahul\n\nThe Evidence Starts to Stack Up (Not to be voiced)\nThese messages revealed something far more critical: Jesus had blatantly lied to the police. To make matters worse, the ring camera footage from Mia’s house showed her walking toward the front of the neighborhood, just as Jordan had claimed. Investigators believed Jesus had suggested this route to avoid having his car captured on any security cameras. \n\nIt was clear now that Jesus wasn’t just hiding the truth. He was actively trying to erase it.\nSo far, all investigators knew was that Jesus had been the last person to see Mia alive. There were no visible bruises on her body, no major evidence at the crime scene, and some even questioned whether she had overdosed.\nBut then, a call from the medical examiner’s office would change everything. It didn’t just set the record straight; it gave them something far more unsettling to work with.\n\nWith that, the police reached out to Jesus. They remained skeptical, unsure if it was the right move to contact him or if he would slip away, knowing the police were onto his lies.\n\n\nHours later, on July 17, 2024, Jesus arrived for a formal interrogation.\n\n\nDuring the interview, Jesus remained unnervingly calm, as if he had memorized a script and was sticking to it.\n\nHis constant denial was infuriating. But detectives had already found the dark secret he tried to hide, and now they were ready to confront him with it.\n\nJesus was acting naive, but detectives saw right through it. They knew they had a suspect who was lying. Now, it wasn’t about whether he did it. It was about why?\n\nTwo lives were gone, and the one man who could explain it all responded with indifference. \n\nJesus just sat there silent. No emotion. No regret. Just a cold, detached stare, like it was all some twisted inconvenience.\n\nDetectives tried everything in the books, even appealing to whatever humanity he had left. \nBut at that point, the real question was whether he had any at all.\nIf anything could prove he was at the crime scene during the murder, it was his phone. Police were about to get that crucial detail, but until then, they feared he might run to evade capture. As a result, he was charged with making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nThe Hidden Lies (Not to be voiced)\nNext, detectives went through his phone. When they had checked his messages with Mia during the interrogation, they realized much had been deleted. They feared other evidence might be gone as well. But shockingly, just a few more taps revealed a web of lies they hadn’t anticipated.\n\nIn his phone, detectives found a conversation with his ex-girlfriend, one that took place just hours before her death. And it could shed disturbing light on Jesus’s possible motive.\n\nThere were countless ways to try and win his girlfriend back, but no one would have guessed this was the one he chose.\nMoreover, the cell phone company records provided damning evidence, placing Jesus at the crime scene on the day of the murder. With this, officers visited him at the Gwinnett County Jail on July 23, 2024. However, they couldn’t question him further without his attorney present since the preliminary trial had already taken place.\n\nDespite the serious charges against him, Monroy was released on a $56,000 bond on August 29, 2024, posting just 10% of the amount.\nHowever, things took a dramatic turn on February 13, 2025, when a Gwinnett County grand jury indicted him on additional charges, including statutory rape, child molestation, and enticing a child for indecent purposes. This came after new evidence was uncovered by the District Attorney’s Special Victims Unit.\nAfter six months of walking free, Monroy was taken back into custody, this time, with no bond and nowhere to run. In court, even more details came to light, making the case against him even stronger. \n\n\nThis hearing focused on whether Jesus should be granted bail again. But he had already shown signs of trying to run. When officers moved in to arrest him the second time, he allegedly tried to flee. A police drone captured it all from above his house. But officers managed to track him down inside the house and placed him in the back of a patrol car.\n\nThe judge didn’t make a decision right away. But when the ruling finally came, it stunned everyone. Jesus Monroy was granted a $150,000 cash bond on the new charges. According to online records, he has since been released from custody. He’s now under strict house arrest, ordered to have no contact with Mia Campos’s family, and must wear a 24/7 ankle monitor.\n\n\n\n",
