  "script_text": "Introduction (Not to be voiced)\n\nCops arresting this man for shoplifting have no idea he is tied to a crime scene of unimaginable brutality, a connection that will only come to light with a 911 call.\n\n\n\nBut getting to the real killer won’t be easy, and the truth is a twist no one sees coming.\n\n\nA Disturbing Discovery (Steffy)\nOn November 5, 2017, officers rush to Brook Haven Park West on Glade Lane after a terrifying 911 call, only to uncover one of the most brutal crimes they have ever faced.\n\nWhat they find is horrifying: a woman lying face down, her face severely beaten. But the details reveal something even darker: her pants lie beside her body, suggesting sexual assault.\n\n\nOfficers ask the witnesses to stay for questioning and begin discussing what they have seen.\n\nThe scene is gruesome, but the victim’s identity remains unknown. With no ID or wallet to guide them, investigators questioned the 911 caller and people who discovered the victim.\n\nThe initial questions lead to nothing, and soon, detectives arrive at the scene, beginning to scour every detail.\n\nBlood evidence shows that the attack occurred at the top of the stairs leading down to where the body was found.\n\nThe victim's black Nike shoes with pink swooshes are found separately from her body, along with a blood-soaked jacket laid over her.\n\nThis leads officers to search for a suspect whose shoes would match the print and likely have blood on them, a search that quickly yields a promising new clue.\n\nThe suspect’s partial bloody shoe print, identified as a Nike Air Force 1, gives detectives a clear direction. While some officers check the shoes of those at the scene, others launch a door-to-door canvas of the neighborhood. Most neighbors heard nothing unusual that night.\nBut one neighbor steps forward with details.\n\nArmed with this description and knowing about the Air Force 1 shoes, officers return to the crime scene area. That's when they spot someone who fits the profile perfectly – a man named Bruce.\n \nWhen they photograph his shoes, they notice a red stain consistent with blood on his Nike Air Force 1. The same shoe that left prints at the crime scene.\n\nWith the blood and shoe print matching, Bruce becomes a person of interest, and officers bring him in for questioning.\n\nInterrogations (Steffy)\n\nNot satisfied with his story, investigators collect Bruce's DNA. However, knowing the results could take months, they focus on finding his brother, George.\nMeanwhile, detectives struggling to identify the victim find no leads- until a Facebook post showing her distinctive shoes prompts a call from a woman named Frederica, who identifies her.  In an instant, she turns the case from a mystery about an unknown woman into a hunt for her killer.\n\nOfficers now finally know the victim: 29-year-old Vanessa Tsosie, a mother of two. Beyond her identity, Frederica also gives crucial details about their last conversation.\n\nInvestigators suspect the man in the call might be the killer. When shown the suspects, Frederica drops a bombshell: her family knew both Bruce and George years earlier, back when they all lived in Red Valley.\nThis revelation makes finding George more urgent than ever. But before they can even launch a full-scale manhunt, fate intervenes and George is arrested for shoplifting, giving investigators the chance to question him. \n\nInvestigators take George’s DNA after he denies everything, just like Bruce. While waiting for the results, an inmate named Ethan contacts police, claiming he has crucial information about the homicide.\n\nDetectives review Walmart security footage expecting to see Bruce or George, but Ethan’s tip instead leads them to a new suspect. After releasing the footage to the public, the man is identified as Kyle, a violent repeat offender.\n\nHis history of violence against women makes him a viable suspect for Vanessa's brutal murder.\n\nDespite their doubts, detectives secure his DNA. \n\nDNA FINDINGS (Suchandrima)\n\nWith multiple suspects, each sounding suspicious, everything now hinges on the results.\n\nBut what the DNA reveals next isn’t just evidence, it’s a game-changer.\n\nJimmy arrives not to face a basic interrogation but to undergo a planned and detailed round of questioning.\n\nJimmy’s version of events now aligns with the facts provided by Vanessa’s family. Detectives now know the truth straight from the person who experienced it. And that’s where the mystery transforms into a walking nightmare.\n\nEric, Jimmy, and Vanessa are drinking at the park. But the night doesn’t end with just the three of them. A fourth figure enters the picture—Alvin. And with Alvin’s arrival, the night spirals into something far darker.\n\nSix names sit on the board, yet the puzzle gets more confusing. The trail might seem frozen, but the next discovery by the detectives changes everything they believed.\n\nQUESTIONING ERIC (Suchandrima)\n\n\n\n\nAnd when the cops try to corner Alvin, the mask begins to slip.\n\nInvestigators now have Alvin's name and his DNA. A small theft turns out to be the key they need to move forward. Alvin, however, lives within the Navajo Nation, outside their jurisdiction. This situation pushes them to team up with tribal investigators to collect evidence and take pictures of his home.\nThe case appears to be on the verge of breaking wide open, but ultimately unravels in ways no one predicted.\n\nThe detectives are back to square one, but their last missing piece is Eric—and his arrest in Colorado may finally unlock the real truth.\n\nWhen asked about Jimmy and Alvin, he claims he has never heard of them. \n\n(Steffy)\nEric pretends to be innocent, but investigators quickly press him on his weak alibi. Under pressure, his story begins to change. \n\nHaving already denied knowing Vanessa, this new claim strikes detectives as a clear effort to cover his tracks. But they press harder, leading to a confession that could rewrite the entire case.\n\n\nMonths after the interviews, the final DNA results provide the answer investigators needed. Eric's DNA shows no evidence of sexual assault. The blood DNA found on Vanessa's body matches Alvin - confirming him as the killer. \n\n\nProsecutors find little evidence to charge to charge Eric; unable to prove his role in the murder. Though Alvin is confirmed as Vanessa’s killer, he’ll never face trial, leaving the truth exposed, but justice undone\n\n\n\n",
