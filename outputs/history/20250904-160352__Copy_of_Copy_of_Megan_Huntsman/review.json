  "weaknesses": [
    "Darren's potential involvement is resolved too cleanly, losing lingering suspense.",
    "Occasional true crime clichés dull the narrative edge.",

    "Early background exposition slightly slows the initial discovery.",
    "Too many mini-hooks are vague, failing to sharpen curiosity.",
    "The script completely lacks an overall outro, leaving the case unresolved and without emotional closure."

  "drop_off_risks": [
    "Early discovery sequence (~01:00-01:30): Background exposition on Darren's house and family slows the initial tension. Fix: Condense and reframe to keep focus on the unfolding crime scene.",
    "After initial baby discovery (~04:00-05:00): Procedural recap instead of an immediate next question creates a lull. Fix: Insert an immediate, unresolved question about the scale of the horror.",
    "Before major reveal of multiple bodies (~06:00-07:00): Background on Megan's addiction delays the shocking confession. Fix: Reorder addiction context to after the full confession.",
    "End of script: Abrupt ending with no overall case resolution or emotional echo. Fix: Add a dedicated outro section for closure and lasting impact."
  ],
  "viral_quotient": "The script's strong hook, escalating suspense, and generally effective pacing create high retention through the main narrative. However, the complete absence of an outro leaves the audience without resolution, significantly hindering its shareability and overall viral potential."
